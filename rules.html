        <p class= "racetext rulestext">1 - Don't be a jackass: It's really simple, don't act untowards with other players, be kind and respectful, and always remember that everyone is here to have fun. Just like you.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">2 - NSFW and risky content: Do not post NSFW content in any but the designated channels, do not violate discord TOS, or post any harmful links. If you're in doubt that what you're posting crosses the line, just don't.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">3 - Common courtesy: Don't be inflammatory or condescending towards your fellow players, this isn't CS:GO, no one is keeping score. We make good stories together, it is cooperative roleplay, not competitive.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">4 - Zero tolerance on harassment: Harassment, derogatory comments based on race, sexual orientation or gender, will not be tolerated in the slightest. Neither will unwanted soliciting in through our discord be.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">5 - No holdover grudges: Do not bring old drama with you, or target people. Be an adult and try to move past old wounds and slights. </p>

        <h3><a href="#character" id="character_rule">Character Creation</a></h3>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">1 - Stay within what's reasonable: This means your character must look appropriate to their chosen race, their IQOL and facial sliders must be proportionate. Some creative liberties we do allow, but please avoid making your toon look like the Michelin man or a balloon animal. </p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">2 - Do not use attachments not meant for your race: If you come into possession of a supernatural attachment not meant for your race/class, report this to staff immediately, under very special exceptions can a character be allowed physical attachments that are usually not a part of their kit, but this is with staff permission only. </p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">3 - No Mary Sue/Gary Stue background story: It is fine to make a noble, or upstanding character, but do not make them flawless, Perfect, or otherwise unbelievable. A character should have, and needs flaws to actually function as a storytelling entity, and it is poor form to make a character that is "better, Stronger, faster" than any other from background alone. Aspiring to greater power is a potent motivator, but no character enters the setting anywhere near godhood. </p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">4 - Read and understand the limitations and restrictions put on your race/Class: This means respecting things such as height slider limitations, understanding the roleplay restrictions that come with certain races and classes, and not abusing their kits for unintended mechanical advantage.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">5 - No alternate accounts/second characters: You are allowed one character at a time, you may shelve a character after 1 month of playing if you wish to try something different, but please ensure you close all roleplay ties/storylines your character has been a part of before doing this.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">6 - When you are re-rolled, Leave your current clan: While we do not wish to split friends apart, we highly encourage players to roleplay their way back in on their next character, or maybe even go out on new adventures. This generates new plots, rather than keep things stale, Cliques and Niches tend to solidify over time, but we are one big community, we all play together, not against each other. Give others a chance. </p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">7 - All characters must be above the age of 18, or their race's analogue: No exceptions, this is a dark and unforgiving setting filled with adult themes. If we catch so much as a whiff of anyone violating this rule, the hammer will come down fast.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">8 - No bleeding IC and OOC: People are not their characters. While it is natural to feel invested and connected to one's character, under no circumstance should actions taken towards your character be viewed as hostile actions towards yourself as a player. Reach out to one another if the roleplay strays into dark territory, but don't forget that behind every character is a player, here with the same intention as you: To have fun. </p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">9 - You must set your discord nickname to match your character's name: Once you have created a character, you must set your discord nickname to match with your characters. This is to make it easier for staff to reach out in case there is a building report made, or we need to get in touch for any reason.</p>

        <h3><a href="#roleplay" id="roleplay_rule">Roleplay and Immersion</a></h3>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">1 - We use custom lore, if something is altered from a 3rd party source, do not attempt to lawyer the lore: You may find our own custom supernatural lore within #server-lore, we use the Conan Lore archives for our vanilla human races and locations, but if playing a supernatural, the servers custom lore takes precedence.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">2 - Do not powergame or Godmode: This means, do not emote doing something to another character without allowing them a chance to affect the narrative. (I.E: John throws a spear at Sarah, impaling her through the shoulder) - This would be an example of how not to write an emote, because it takes away Sarah's agency, a better way to write it would be: John throws his spear towards Sarah, aiming for the shoulder - This emote is an attempt, it shows an impending action about to happen, and allows for Sarah to write a response, finalizing the action.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">3 - You are In Character 100% of the time, do not dodge roleplay or chimp around: On our server, you are always in character, the only exception to this being if you were downed in PVP and are returning to your corpse, or during character creation at the starting area, at all other times, you are IC (in character) and have to respond to any emote directed at you. Also, do not jump around wildly, meme emote, or in other ways ruin immersion for other players, humour is always welcome in RP, but being a jackass about it is not the way to go.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">4 - Warps and travel: We use warps to save on travel time, or for quickly finding RP. However: - You may not warp after a raid declaration, if you are the raiding party or the defending party. - You may not camp warpsites</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">5 - Be mindful of meta: We understand that if something exciting happens, you want to share that excitement, either with your friends in Voice chat, in-game chats, or on discord. While we won't police chatter between friends, we ask you to please be mindful of what information your share concerning the roleplay, most people are not malign or intentional metagamers, but when you know something, it is easier to slip. So in the interest of helping yourself and your friends not to metagame, wait 12-24 hours after the roleplay has occured to share it. Metagaming is, as is often said, Roleplay Cancer. Don't do it. </p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">6 - Do not set your home inside dungeons, near bosses, or in locations that is not your IC home: You may not abuse the /sethome command to be within dungeons, instances, or in locations for farming. 7 - No streaming: We may make exceptions for this during public world events and the like (the announced ones) but overall, do not stream while playing on our server. This is mainly to avoid leaking meta, and also for you to not get your account striked for NSFW if you ever find yourself in the presence of... ahem sparingly clad individuals. </p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">7 - All character names must be suited to the setting: Do not play a Stygian named John, or a Turanian named Bob. Research relevant background lore for your character so they may have a name that does not stick out like a sore thumb. Also avoid making pop-culture references such as naming your toon "Targaryen" or "Johnny Snow"</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">8 - Dice: Any roll made in roleplay, insofar as it is not a class or racial ability, is by consent only. If you want to do flavour magic in roleplay, or pickpocket someone, you are free to do so, just bear in mind this will not be enforced, and you are likewise not obligated to honor a dice roll that goes outside of our custom system.</p>

        <h3><a href="#pvp" id="pvp_rule">PvP and Raiding</a></h3>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">1 - NO KOS: Kill On Sight is prohibited on our server. What this means is that you may not engage anyone in PVP, or deal damage to them in any way, shape or form without a prior roleplay emote including (PVP INTENT) at the start, and at the end, Anyone within hearing range of this emote must then respond with an emote of their own with (PVP ACCEPT) Within it, at the start of the emote, and at the end. This is to signal readiness, and the parties involved may then also describe their next action, whether they engage, or choose to disengage from the fight. Once everyone is done with their declaration and are ready, the person furthest away may start the countdown from 5, once it reaches 1, the fight may begin.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">2 - You may use either a pet if you are a Demonologist or a Ranger in PVP. You may not use both a mount or pet however, and must choose between either: This is fairly self explanatory, you are not allowed to be mounted, and have a thrall following you at the same time, you will have to choose wich you wish to use, if any is applicable. Please ensure that your class/Race does not have any restrictions on mounts or thralls before using them, if you have a restriction against using something, that restriction goes for PVE as well.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">3 - A raid must be cleared with an available admin in a ticket prior to a raid declaration being posted: All raids must have an uninvolved staff member present overseeing them to ensure rules are followed, as well as having the opposing party present to defend. A defending clan must have at least half of it's active members online for a raid to be performed against them.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">4 - Only video footage, or in rare exceptions, screenshots are viable evidence in a PVP dispute: This sadly comes down to a lot of things turning into a He said/She said argument. To enable shadowplay there are several free types of software available online, or if you have Nvidia, you can enable it by pressing Shift + Z (default) while in game</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">5 - No Raiding of the structures marked as ADMIN: Building damage is usually set to off and will be enabled during a raid declaration, or for special events. Under no circumstance may this be used as a loophole to damage/destroy or raid admin structures such as the hub, spawn room or library.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">6 - Do not grief or cause excessive damage when raiding: Raids must have a roleplay reason, and an objective, you may not needlessly destroy anything but what's necessary to accomplish the stated objective.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">7 - Upon being downed in PVP, you MUST Return to the scene for consequence roleplay: Being downed in PVP does not mean your character died, the outcome of a fight can be anything ranging from antagonistic roleplay, to severe consequences such as character death. The consequence should match the preceding roleplay, big cons, require big roleplay.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">8 - Injured Status: When you have suffered a defeat in a PVP engagement, your character may not initiate or engage in PVP for 12 hours afterwards, this varies some between races, be sure to read up on your own race's merits and flaws, Ignorance of the rule is not an excuse.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">9 - Pillaging and Theft: You may steal items worth a net total of 10 gold off of a player, or max 5 items up to a stack.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">10 - PvP is IC: Whether you are in PvP or not, you are always IC. The actions of other characters before, during, and after PvP are all allowed. RP is not paused during PvP. The scene is only paused during the intent phase, when everyone declares their intent.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">11 - When a player is downed, the downed player can only be dragged off by someone who has joined PVP. If someone outside of PVP wishes to drag another wounded player off the battlefied, they must /shout PVP Join and their emote of them dragging the player off. The player being dragged must crouch walk with the player dragging them out of sight of the combatants before running. All actions of dragging another player off need to be emoted.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">12 - You may not warp after a raid declaration, if you are the raiding party or the defending party. - You may not camp warpsites</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">13 - The hub that is more evil in nature which is built on the Isle of Dusk, you will not be safe from PVP. As for Moonfall, which is our hub in the Redwoods, uou may only PVP skirmish in here. There are guards as well, and you do not want to fight these guards.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">14 - Anything near the portal or city is considered the hub. If a fight is started within this area and taken outside of it, it is still considered a skirmish.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">15 - Skirmish consequences are consented to by both parties and will never be too extreme. Skirmish consequences do not give injuries unless agreed upon by both parties. No permadeath shall be given in skirmish consequences.</p>

        <h3><a href="#consequences" id="consequences_rule">Consequences and Captivity</a></h3>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">1 - Slavery and You: If you have been captured and kept without RP for 30 minutes, you may pull the bracelet to "escape". Likewise, if you have been held for 6 hours with 'Slavery - No' On your consent sheet, you may RP an escape attempt the same way. Do not abuse this rule to ruin Roleplay, if you become engaged in captivity roleplay, try to give it a chance, most of the time if you end up captured it means story. This rule really is just here to avoid captivity used to deny people roleplay, not negate valid antagonism.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">2 - Do not coerce people into altering their consent sheet: If someone has No to either slavery or rape on their consent sheet, you are not allowed in any way, shape, or form to attempt coercing them into accepting these cons by pressure, such as giving them the option of either "Do this, or your toon gets permed." No exceptions.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">3 - Big Consequences, Require Big Roleplay: If you are giving someone heavy consequences, it is a requirement that the preceding roleplay reflects that severity. "It's just how my character does things" is not a valid reason for first encounter permaing someone. If a consequence is given out without adequate roleplay, it will be retconned and the perpetrator reprimanded depending on the severity.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">4 - You may appeal Permadeath if you feel it was done poorly: If you do suffer heavy consequences and do not feel as if though it was justified trough RP, we are always open to appeal it, make sure you gather screenshot evidence to back up your claim, without evidence, we do not have the facts necessary to make a solid judgement.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">5 - Stacking of consequences: You cannot stack consequences from the same encounter. If someone agrees to enslavement for instance, you cannot perma them, same being that if you rob someone, or maim someone, you cannot perma them. Remember that consequences are a tool for driving story, and under no circumstance should "my" story, come before "anyone else's" story.</p>

        <h3><a href="#buildings" id="buildings_rule">Buildings, Pets and Mounts</a></h3>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">1 - Building allowances: Solo players get 500 Building pieces, and 100 placeables, after that, Each player added to clan gets 350 Building pieces and 75 placeables.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">2 - Thralls and Pets: Each player gets to have one companion, either a thrall, or a pet, as well as one mount. Where it makes sense, the mount may be swapped for a pet.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">3 - Do not block off important sites, thrall camps, or dungeons: Building within instanced areas (Vaults, Dungeons, any place that requires a loading screen to get trough) is with explicit staff permission only. Also be sure to not block off major resource deposits, routes of traversal, or thrall camps. Builds found to be in violation of this rule are subject to Admin demolition without warning or reimbursement.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">4 - No build exploits or unraidable bases: Do not exploit the games raiding mechanics to make your base unraidable. I.E building on top of a pillar, anticlimbing a steep hill, bases that only can be accessed by flight etc. This really comes down to consideration on a case by case basis, if you are found to be in violation of a rule, you will be asked to amend it within 24 hours or an admin will do it for you (may or may not be gentle)</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">5 - Player hubs: Any player hub built with the intention of generating roleplay, be it a tavern, town, religious institution or other, may request a warp. Builds found to satisfy niche criteria of aesthetics and proper setup will be granted one. </p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">6 - Mounts and Followers: You may chose between having either a mount, or a companion following you while you are out, not both, no exceptions. This goes for PVE as well.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">7 - All builds must look architecturally sound and feasible: This means that living in a sandstone shoebox will be frowned upon, and perhaps even draw our very own buildmonger's ire. You don't have to be a master builder to put a simple roof on your home, make your build look fitting to what you are playing, and like a place someone would actually live.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">8 - Builds may be up to 8 blocks high: Certain exceptions can be made with admin approval, show us what you plan to make and we'll greenlight it if it looks feasible. Bottom foundations and roofing does not count towards this limit.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">9 - Only one animal taming pen, thrall wheel, and compost heap per clan: These placeables put immense strain on the server when in high numbers, so they are forcibly limited to one of each per clan. Thralls and Pets tame instantly on our server, so there is no need for more than one.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">10 - For clan warps, clans of 5+ may purchase a warp for their clan at the price of 50 gold.</p>

        <p class= "racetext rulestext">Mildly Injured - Basic Injury status after being defeated in PVP, this player can no longer engage in PVP for the duration of their PVP consequences, and lasts for 12 hours after the initial PVP has concluded. Cannot Initiate PVp, but can defend thesmelves.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">Moderately Injured - Injury status typically inflicted by the Victor in a Consequence of PVP, or through RP itself. The player cannot engage in PVP for 24 hours, and must PVP Surrender or PVP Flee.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">Severely Injured - Injury Status typically inflicted by PVP Con or RP. A severely Injured Player cannot do anything but PVP Surrender when an intent is dropped. They are typically injured, maimed, or on the brink of death. This will last 48 hours, after 48 hours with no FIrst Aid or Healing magic this character will suffer death.</p>

        <h4>First Aid Skill Roll Table</h4>
        </p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">Rolling between a 5-10 will cure the player of a Mildly Injured Status Effect.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">11-15 will Shorten Moderately Injured by 12 Hours, if the player has 12 hours or less on their Moderately Injured status they will then be cured.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">16-20 Will Accomplish all of the previous effects, but will also reduce a Severely Injured Status to Moderately Injured, and the Severely Injured player will no longer be on death's door.</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">If a player succeeds at a roll on an injured player, that player will no longer benefit from First Aid on their injury</p>
        <p class= "racetext rulestext">Healing Magic Will heal all wounds, regardless of first aid being applied or not.</p>
