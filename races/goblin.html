      <p class="racebox">The Goblins have are an old race, reduced to that of myths and stories to scare children. Most of their lives they spent dwelling deep within the earth, fighting with the dwarves for supremacy over these depths filled with riches, using their large numbers to overwhelm the dwarf’s sturdy battle lines and holds. Their weapons were as crude as the minds, scraps of metal shaped into sharp ends, and occasionally sharpened blades if they were able to come by one capable of crafting them.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Small, green, and gangly. Goblins are a small race of humanoids, a good few feet shorter than an average human, with a skinny, wiry build, though a more well-off goblin might have a bit more meat on their bones. Their skin ranges from primarily a green tone, some darker, and some lighter than others, even sometimes a greyish green in shade. Their hair is black, though in their culture it is not uncommon to see goblins dye their hair very strange colors for no particular reason at all.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Where the goblins lack in physical strength individually, they make up for in sheer number. Where there is one, always suspect there is another, or several others lurking nearby. Loyalty is next to unheard of within the Goblin society, their horde usually following a single figure that shows slightly more intelligence or strength than the others, in most cases a hob-goblin but this is not always the case. When the leader dies, it will send the goblins into a near-frenzy for power for who will take over the top spot.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Despite their reputation, goblins do not lack any form of intelligence and can be quite clever in some aspects. Their ability to see reason, or show empathy with others is an uncommon trait, but their ability to devise traps for their dwarven rivals, or for the captives they will take from the surface. Due to the goblin’s lack of any decent craftsmanship, goblins resort to capturing surface dwellers and forcing them to help forge better equipment or luring others into traps for either more captives or shinnies.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Goblins are stupid but very clever. By modern standards they are street-smart. Their goals are usually very simple for the rank and file goblin. Which is to obtain the biggest treasure pile. They tend to follow the strongest and smartest among them, as that means more wealth and a higher chance of surviving. They usually have patchwork armor and crudely constructed weapons. Most armors looted from humans, elves, or dwarves are either too large to fit properly, or too heavy, and are usually dismantled and certain parts strapped onto their body. They have an absolute loathing for dwarves, and more recently the Khorgrohk's who have begun helping them. Seeking an ally of their own, some goblins have taken to working for the Dark Elves, though the dark elves are wary about such deals, as they could easily find themselves in a goblin cave working for them one day.</p>
