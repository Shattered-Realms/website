      <p class="racebox">Dark Elves are an ancient, twisted race of elves, descendent of the Moon Elves. A rebellious group that sought power over their kin and their realm of existence, they forged a pact with Zath, Gita, and Ohm. These people are what many of the Hyborian races came to know as the Zhemri, and could even be the origin of worship for these spider deities throughout the Thurian continent after the downfall of Zarfkhaan, the pre-cataclysmic kingdom that eventually reformed into what is known today, as Zamora.</p>
      <p class="racebox">The magic they were given twisted not only their minds but even their appearance. Their skin became darker, usually in shades of light grey, but in some cases much darker. Their hair often took on a silver-white, but it was not uncommon for Dark Elves to dye it shades like purple, blue, or black. They are built very similarly to those of the Moon Elves, with slender forms. They usually held a much darker beauty than their Moon or Sun kin, their appearance usually as alluring as it was frightening.</p>
      <p class="racebox">The Dark Elves are a spiteful race, holding hatred for their elven cousins. Their culture is built off of subtle power, and the ability to achieve it. Whether it be through prowess, diplomacy, subterfuge, or seduction, all these aspects were to be both respected and feared. Mercy was usually not shown to the enemy of a family or political party, unless they had some form of use, to help elevate themselves even higher. The Dark Elves were ruled by a Monarchy, which was not inherited by a monarch's bloodline, but by whoever was in possession of the Black Crown. An ancient crown made of Obsidian that supposedly gave its wearer enhanced both physical and mental capability. Not just anyone could obtain it and claim the throne however, only those with renown amongst their kin could seize power. Their economy is heavily influenced and based on slavery, be it labor, or for pleasure. Races such as the Khorgrohks, Dragonborn, or even Humans in recent years are used for their brawn and in the form of manual labor. As for the elves, they are used for entertainment in many different ways. There is no patriarchy or matriarchy in the dark Elf Society. Both males and females are respected by one another, understand that each has its own strengths and weaknesses to be used or exploited.</p>
      <p class="racebox">The Dark Elves are very selfish, and untrustworthy people. They are just as likely to sell out their family if it will benefit them as much as they would their enemies. They are not so forward about it however and can be very charismatic, using either their wit or perhaps their own sex appeal to get what they want. There is almost no limit to what a Dark Elf is willing to do to achieve their ambitions. You can see Dark Elves filling a variety of roles in their society, and none are looked down upon, such as Warriors, Mages, Prostitutes, or priests. And you could probably see a Dark Elf warrior fighting one week, then whoring themselves out the next.</p>
