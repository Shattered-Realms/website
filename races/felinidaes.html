      <p class="racebox">The Felindae hailed from the land of Stygia, and were usually depicted as creatures that protected the otherworldly pathways that connected the material plane to that of the afterlife, ensuring that vengeful or evil spirits don't once more find themselves in the land of the living. This feline race of shapeshifters was usually depicted around the Goddess Derketo, which in turn they were at times either violent, or very sexual, or even both, taking on the aspects of the goddess.

Though they are heavily associated with the Goddess, they are not bound to her ideals or even the lifestyle of a Stygian, and it is not unheard of for these beings to be seen elsewhere, trying to live a different life than that of their kin back in Stygia.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Felindae range from small, and nimble to that of a small housecat, to the large and fierce-like features of a Tiger. They are born with a resemblance to a certain feline and hold it until the day they die. When in their human form, their features are usually pointed, and the colors of their hair and body usually reflect that of their feline form as well. They are obsessed with cleanliness, and usually always keep their hair or fur in the primmest of conditions.</p>
      <p class="racebox">In the present day, the Felindae are much like the Kitsune in their desire for solitude. When they do reveal themselves it is usually met with reverence when in Stygia, and though some of the Felindae enjoy this, most find it more of an annoyance, and would rather live in peace and secrecy. When outside of Stygia, the Felindae are not well known, but most cultures look at anything supernatural such as the Felindae as evil and are met with distrust and often even violence. Thus, pushing these creatures to a life of secrecy when outside of their home country.

However, in the Isle of Siptah, amongst so many other creatures that are both Supernatural and not of this world, it has allowed them to be more open to what they are.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Felindae can be played in a variety of ways, if they are devout worshipers of Derketo they can often be quite sexual and playful, and very open about what they are amongst their own home, temple, or establishment. The males can be the same way, but they usually find themselves drawn towards the deathly side of Derketo, and are often more war-like and larger in appearance as well.</p>
