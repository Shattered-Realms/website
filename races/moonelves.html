      <p class="racebox">The Moon Elves are a curious, adventurous, and kind-hearted race of humanoids hailing from the Fae Realm. Unlike their purist cousins the Sun Elves, they believe that interacting with other races than their own is beneficial to all. To learn what others do, how they survive, their culture, and their ways of waging war. They take these things that work, or the like and make them their own, and discard what does not. It also allows them to have an advantage if war ever does arise, as knowing your enemy is always a tactical advantage.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Moon elves usually have soft, or pointed features, and never seem to look like they've aged past their mid-twenties until they begin to reach the end of their life cycles, which typically last around 850 years. Their hair comes in dark tones like brown, black, silver, and sometimes with blueish or purple hues. Their skin is normally pale to light tan, sometimes light blue or purple, usually with bright blue or green eyes. A moon elf is usually a slender being, more so than humans, though their height ranges are about the same. Their small stature can be deceiving, however, as their muscle and bone density is a bit superior to that of an ordinary human, giving the elves a hint more dexterity and speed.</p>
      <p class="racebox">In the fae realm the moon elves are the most elite of archers, only rivaled by their kin that live in the thick forests of their world. They make expert rangers and hunters, making them good scouts in war, and a few even take up the work as bounty hunters or even assassins. One factor that really assists a Moon Elf is their eyesight, and the eagle-like ability to zoom their vision in on a target, focus on it, even blocking out any distractions to focus on a particularly difficult shot. Even back in their home realm, the Moon Elves were never ones to settle permanently, that is not to say they did not have cities of their own, and quite majestic were the cities they did build. But for the most part, they could be seen traversing the world through back roads, the wilderness, and even the wild and unpredictable sea. If war ever came to the Elven cities by the sea, it was the Moon Elves that primarily manned the ships, while the Sun Elves and Wood Elves provided the bulk for the land forces.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Most Moon Elves were kind-hearted, and adventurous, but there are always extremists amongst any population, this is no different for these people. There are some that would not trust any outsiders, especially humans and the other creatures that inhabit this new world they now find themselves in. One thing that might instill a bit of distrust among the Elves with Humans was their first interaction with the Khorgrohks. What seemed to start out on good relations and the hope for peace quickly turned to the Khorgrohks seeking to subjugate their people, which has no result in an unending world between the Elves and the Khorgrohks.</p>
