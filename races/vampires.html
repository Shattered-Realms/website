      <p class="racebox">Vampires are creatures that thrive in the darkness and have an insatiable desire for blood. Some may crave the blood of different species more than others, and perhaps even finding the blood of more magical or afflicted beings addictive even. Their state is seen by many as a curse, even by those that are afflicted. Then there are those that also see such a thing as a blessing, and even seek out those that may bestow it upon them. Vampires are not inherently evil but are usually forced into committing horrible acts either out of self-preservation. The desire for blood becomes too strong that even the strongest of wills are broken, and send the Vampire into a blood frenzy, seeking out the nearest being to make it a meal. Creatures gifted or perhaps cursed with life unending if not ended by spell or blade, they are often seen as malicious creatures, schemers, and opportunists to those that can see past their undead veil.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Vampires are quite distinct in their appearances. The life often drained from their human bodies often leave their skin pale and sickly looking, their faces sometimes grow narrower as of a shriveled corpse, but that often depends upon the one who embraced them within the life. A common trait that all of the vampires possess is their signature blood-red eyes, which grow in intensity whenever the Vampire has not fed in a while, or while their predatorial instincts have taken over in search of their prey. Ontop, Vampires possess fangs, some being able to hide them at will while others unable of conducting this feat, however, what remains is the strength of the fangs being closer to the finer metals, able to pierce through leather and sometimes even armor in search of the creatures' veins. Other than that, Vampires vary wildly in body shapes and tones. Some are still capable of growing bodily hair, while some lose that ability entirely.  Vampiresâ€™ bodies are cold as the graves they rose out of. With no circulation of blood within their veins, they touch is cold and unwelcoming, and often one of the telltales signs that the creature is a bloodsucker.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Vampires being often shunned from the mortal societies, and seeing their former friends and family as mere prey, led to them creating few distinct ways of living. In the few societies that they are accepted, they are often shunned and used as instruments of war, fed animal or blood of the recently deceased or convicted to death, and treated more as tools rather than the beings they truly are. Those Vampires often are seen as more mindless husks.
Otherwise, many Vampires acquired themselves to conduct within one of a few ways, most choosing to go with a more dignified and sophisticated way of life, gathering within secret communities led by those of higher standard and bloodlines that rule as Kings and Queens of the Night. These Vampire houses often disguise themselves as wealthy merchants and petty rulers to the humans and tend to be seen as sophisticated and excentric, while in truth they hide most devious of secrets behind their stone walls.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Some, however, choose some alternate paths. Often either by themselves as Rogues that manage to slip by within the same societies they were a part of, or turning to nature and becoming more feral predators, sometimes vowing with lycanthropes for their hunting grounds but such is a rare occasion, more often than not lycanthropes and vampires have been recorded interacting with each other and even allying to defend against a common threat.

Societies at large see Vampirism as a product of unholy sorcery and are shunned and killed. Even in those more tolerant, it is not something that should be flaunted, and as such Vampires tend to stick to themselves or other groups of untouchables and undesirables. More often than not, they live in secrecy, but their gifts granting them such powers that many see as quite useful in means of subterfuge and spycraft.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Vampires are not inherently evil, however upon turned their emotions tend to grow stronger and take more of hold upon the creature. A dislike could turn into hate, love to an obsession, and so on. Many do not resist their newfound urges, while some do. Roleplaying a Vampire brings forth a very interesting dynamic for a player character, with a constant need to feed upon blood, and many vampires often having a preferred type, some growing addicted even to the crimson liquid flowing within the veins of magical beings.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Vampires are immortal unless their life was to end under blade or spell as mentioned, which often grants themselves an overblown sense of self, making them either incredibly greedy and self-centered or extremely cautious as they wish to maintain their undying status. Depending upon the Vampire, some might refuse to communicate even with anybody that is not part of their underworld or a kindred, while others relish in communicating with mortals, it truly depends upon the upbringing and the way the Vampire was embraced within the life. Their personalities, however, always tend to be obsessive. Either towards their interests or their long-term goals as Vampirism fuels their emotions to unhealthy levels, making them extremely intense beings when interacted with.</p>
