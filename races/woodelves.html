      <p class="racebox">Wood Elves, unlike their Sun Elf cousins, stray away from the life of civilization. Much preferring the tall Oaks of their forest as opposed to the tall stone walls of many great Elven Cities. This does not mean they hold any ill will towards their city-dwelling cousins, and whenever they do encounter them they do their best to show them the wonders of the woods. Moon Elves typically find themselves living amongst Wood Elves for short periods of time during their travels and learn many of their tracking and navigation spells from them. They are a kind race, in touch with Nature than most other of the races that live in the fae realm apart from the nymphs, which they protect and revere. </p>
      <p class="racebox">Their source of magic usually comes from the 'spirit of the forest', nature itself granting its powers to the druids, mages, or clerics that live amongst their people. This blessing is ever-present and can be felt wherever they go. This does not mean that they are incapable warriors, however, and in fact can be some of the most ruthless people you can find when they are pushed to violence. Acts against the forest are unacceptable and are met with a swift and deadly response, mainly of the elves taking on personas closely resembling beasts of the forest such as wolves, bears, or hawks. Should you be captured after defiling their home, whether it be through foul magic, or trying to cut down their trees for resources, you would not be slain in most cases, rather forced to right your wrongs. The method for this varied, depending on how compliant the captive is being. Captives that were not overly defiant would be put to work restoring what it was they had destroyed, forced to partake in the tribal rituals they used to commune with the forest spirits. While the defiant or overly dangerous foes would typically be cursed by powerful druids, turned into creatures and guardians such as a giant bear that wanders the woods protecting its borders for hundreds of years.</p>
      <p class="racebox">The wood elves were a shorter race than most other elven races, their skin was more coppery in color, while their hair colors ranged from a dirty blonde to a dark brown color. Their eyes were typically green or hazel, but brown was also seen every now and then. Due to their life in the woods, hunting, gathering, moving through the trees, most Wood Elves were well built, and very fit, making them a bit stronger than their kin. Their skill with a bow was only rivaled by that of their Moon Elf brethren, though no one matched their ability to blend in with the forest and keep their movements hidden.</p>
      <p class="racebox">They did not march to war with the other elves unless the war was brought to their own people, then they would do their best to help defend their people from any invaders. The war with the Khorgrohks was one they did not want to be a part of, not agreeing with the Sun Elf's actions and decided to stay within their woods and let them fight their own battle, this did not last though. The Khorgrohks didn't seem to differentiate the different elf races from one another, and soon found their own people being killed or taken as slaves or trophies by the brutish race, and have now engaged in quite a few skirmishes with them on the outskirts of their forest.</p>
