      <p class="racebox italictext">“Despite their foul hearts and evil spirits, these creatures possess the almost supernatural beauty of their more beneficent relatives. They resemble slim, full-bodied women, with delicate features. Thick, resplendent hair, full, pouty lips, and smooth-as-silk skin accentuate their triumphant beauty. Only a brief, calculating smile or an occasional hard glint from their piercing eyes betrays the evil nature of these creatures. Few people, however, can see beyond the unearthly beauty of a corrupted nymph, and into the blackened heart of the evil creature.“</p>
      <p class="racebox">When a nymph's nature is twisted and turned on its head, forced to abandon its nurturing side entirely, the result is often a twisted and devious creature that sows misery and malcontent wherever it goes. Having long since abandoned their duty to life and beauty, they relish in spreading corruption and deceit. Surrounded by an air of decay and suffering, Corrupted nymphs are harbingers of woe and death. Though they may hide their true nature from the unaware, those with second sight may be able to peer past their veneer of grace and beauty to see the withered, blackened heart beneath.</p>
      <p class="racebox">On the surface, they are beautiful, lithe, and graceful, appearing as ethereal and beguiling humanoids, though in their true form, the aspects of rot, decay, and death are plainly visible. Where an Earth nymph may be appearing as an avatar of the woodlands or plains, hair blossoming with growths and life, a corrupted nymph will appear as a withering mass of dead roots, decayed leaves, and dirt, or just a plain lifeless gray. Their eyes are black, bottomless pits, and gazing into them for too long may enthrall the weak-willed, or drive those of lesser faith into insanity.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Like regular nymphs, Corrupted nymphs are not commonplace in settled regions, though they are not shy of slithering around villages to spread their vile influence, or tempt mortals into straying from the path of life and light. Whereas earth nymphs and sky nymphs are seen as near-divine by those who come into contact with them, corrupted nymphs are the antithesis to all life, and seek only to spread rot, death, and misery in their wake.</p>
      <p class="racebox">There is no such thing as a naturally made corrupted nymph, as the name implies, they are always turned from their original path by an outside influence. Whether this be the blackening pull of supernatural forces and dark sorcery, or a horrific incident. They are quite cunning and predatory, though they may tempt mortals with bargains of power, desire, or material gain, their ultimate goal will always be to usurp and twist life away from its self-propagating cycle.</p>
