      <p class="racebox">Wolfmen, beasts, lycans, werewolves. There are many names across the cultures to describe the beasts that lurk within the forests and even towns, hidden by a veil of an elven or a human face. The story goes that long ago, an elven priestess and a human conducted a hideous sacrifice to the Lord of The Hunt, in return for power unending. The sacrifice differs, as so does the tale from region to region, but one thing remains constant, the gift they were given was more of a curse than a great gift. A test, as Jhebbal Sag often enjoyed to put forth to his loyal followers. The gift of lycanthropy was granted, and the human in the tale transformed to a monstrous being, taller than men and beast, with the face of a wolf but standing as tall and proud as a human would.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Werewolves are humans or elves, cursed with the gift or disease of lycanthropy, which allows them to transform into the shape of beasts when the moon rises. They can come from any region or culture, as the gift is widespread, however how different cultures see them is often different, from protectors to outright devils that require purging. They are often close to nature, however, many choosing to refrain from civilization and hideaway in the woods, while others see their affliction as an outright gift, something to make them better and stronger than the rest, and embrace it fully.</p>
      <p class="racebox">While in the form of a werewolf, they adapt the spirit of the hunt. They often grow larger than their normal, human, or elven size with extremely sharp claws and teeth that resemble daggers in strength. Their fur is often the same color as their hair, however, there has been a distinct lack of golden or red-furred werewolves seen around, as some mortals tend to lose color in their hairs after getting afflicted with lycanthropy and tend to get a gray or even white colour instead.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Werewolves come from every corner of the known world. They can be anybody, your neighbor, your lawman, or the man across the street. Other than few characteristics, they are often hard to distinguish between mere mortal men and women, however, they are often seen as beasts and devils, products of foul rituals who often lend them being hunted or driven out of their settlements upon being discovered. Werewolves tend to grow a deeper connection with the woods and nature in general. In societies that accept them, their strength is seen as insanely useful, and often they grow within positions of power due to their abilities, which often feed their egos.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Roleplaying a werewolf is one of the most versatile afflictions. As previously mentioned, they often go one of two paths, however, such is not necessary. They tend to have a closer tie to nature, being more knowledgeable about such things as alchemy due to their ties with the woods, however, many as well grow insanely arrogant and prideful over their conditions, considering themselves as Alphas of their groups, and vowing for power within their organizations, however not everybody sees being a werewolf as being a gift, some do see it as being a curse.
        
        Those, often try to distance themselves as much as possible, either due to a fear of losing control over their transformation or a distaste for the hatred their kin will show them or has shown them. Some decide to be loners, living their lives in abandoned ruins close to the forests if they wish to maintain at least a semblance of civilization, or delve deep within the forests and spend their time with more druidic ways.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Their personalities vary. They grow more bestial after their transformation, more focused upon their instincts rather than logical thoughts, and have more of a trust in those than what they might learn from books or otherwise. However, some choose to completely ignore their instincts and grow on a path of controlling the beast within them to their will, allowing for a complete duality between the human and wolf form.</p>
