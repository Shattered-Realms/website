      <p class="racebox">Wild, soothing, whimsical, yet oddly orderly. The elemental spirits of nature that manifest in areas dense with ancient magic are walking contradictions sometimes, just as ferocious and destructive, calming and constructive as the natural forces they draw from. By and large, Nymphs are shy, playful creatures rarely seen outside of their sacred groves. The three most commonly seen variants are slightly differing from each other, but at the core, they serve the same purpose, namely upholding and safeguarding the untamed wilds in which they make their dwellings. </p>
      <p class="racebox">Nymphs typically do not congregate or thrive in settled areas, but they often play an important part in local myth or legend, both in the prime material realm known to humans and in the mystical fey realm, where their nature is well known to the elves. Of the three variants, Earth Nymphs are the only ones known to willingly let settlers encroach on their territory, insofar as they are beneficial to the wilds they safeguard. Nymphs are not mortal beings, and they are as ageless as the elements from which they originate. They should not be roleplayed as dimwitted or silly, for while they are not scholarly or prone to convoluted speech, they are most certainly not stupid. Temperament, playfulness, speaking in riddles, or having hidden motives could be potent tools for use in RP.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Sky Nymphs tend towards pale through dark blues, with intricate, wisplike markings, and sprite-like wings sprouting from their backs. Soaring high above the world below manifest the soothing spring winds, and the wild autumn storms, making their aeries up in treetops, or on tall cliffs, musically inclined and playful, they tend to be the most rarely sighted due to their fickle nature, but their song can often be faintly heard by human travelers venturing into places of the world where the dividing line between the prime material world and the still magical fey realm is particularly thin, such as untouched vistas of nature.</p>
      <p class="racebox"><img src="../images/races/WaterNymph.png" alt="" class="racepicture"/>Water Nymphs are by far the most well known to sailors who encroach upon treacherous shorelines or straits, just as likely to lull sailors away to their doom with alluring song, as they are to lead them safely through vicious storms. Water nymphs tend towards teals, blues, pale greens, and the colours of the ocean depths, dressing sparingly if at all, they often possess aquatic features that are not apparent from afar, such as webbed hands and feet, gills, or fishlike fins along their spines. </p>
      <p class="racebox">Nymphs are easily confused for humans at a distance, though their stature is notably shorter, and up close, only a blind or deaf fool would take them for anything but over natural creatures, for they project an air of wonder about them, tangible to even the most doubtful of individuals</p>
      <p class="racebox"><img src="../images/races/EarthNymph.png" alt="" class="racepictureright"/>Earth nymphs are the most even-tempered of the lot, often dwelling within the depths of untouched wildlands, being regarded with almost deistic devotion by the Wood-Elves, who tend to see their kind as guardian spirits, a role which they often adopt. For though they are calm and steadfast, they are just as capable of being angered to an extreme degree, particularly when their sacred realm is stirred or trespassed upon without proper respect and reverence.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Earth nymphs are by far the most stocky of the group, though still just as beautiful and enthralling as the wild natural vistas in which they dwell, their skin often taking on brown, green, and bronzed hues.</p>
		<p class="racebox">Nymphs are not mortal beings. They are as ageless as the elements from which they originate.
