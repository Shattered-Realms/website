      <p class="racebox">One of the Elder Races, the Draconians are the creation of the Dead-God, The Dragon-God. Said to have warred in ancient prehistory with the star spawned horrors of the Deep Ones and Snakemen. The Proto-Draconians were referred to in prehistory as the Lizard Kings. Vicious opponents of the other Elder Races and defacto hegemony of the landmass that stretched from Lake Vilayet, across to the Isles of Lemuria and Yamatai.</p>
      <p class="racebox">>Draconian legend is shakey on their mythic past, with Khitan and Yamatai cultures both paint drastically different pictures of the race, from the perspective of those who suffered/thrived beneath autocratic/benevolent rulers.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Both of the major branches of Draconians(Khitani and Yamatai) share most of the same mythic origin. That the Dragon-God came to protect this planet from things of the Outer Dark and enforce Order and Names. By Naming things they were given form and could be controlled or owned by the Dragon-God. A jealous Fish, A cowardly Spider and an unknowable Stranger conspired and set their children to working against the Dragon-God and its offspring. They who spent time among the lesser races. Bringing the gift of fire, of letters, of fish hooks and medicine.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Khitani Draconians tend to be chromatic colors- Reds, Blues, Whites, Greens, Blacks, Yellows. They have distinctly Crocodile features. They tend to be larger and more physically imposing. Sharing more bestial traits with dragons and clearly favoring draconic parentage. It is clear to see if oneâ€™s lineage were of the Sea, Mountains, Deserts, Caves or Calderas as many atavistic traits are still present in the Khitani Lineage. Webbed hands/flippers, traces of once-mighty breath weapons, and the trend towards violently domineering personality traits, or sociopaths. Biologically Khitani is Egg-Layers. Though certain 'questionable bloodlines' may produce live young.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Yamtai Draconians trend towards metallic colors, Brass, Bronze, Gold, Silver, Copper, Platinum, Electrum, Adamantine, even, rumored, legendary Mithril dragons(Which would be colored as the Dragon-God is described). They tend to be more human-like, as they have willingly interbred with multiple other races, and almost always bear live young. While still ectothermic like the Khitani, they tend to 'run hot' and mimic the biological functions of Mammalia as opposed to Reptilian. They often have an otherworldly, supernatural element to them. And where Khitani can be traced based on the area their progenitors made home- the Yamatai is more nebulous, seeming to reflect concepts such as Majesty, Nobility, Law, Curiosity, Inquisitiveness, Glory, etc. Certain Yamatai develops odd horn growths around their eyebrows, upper lips, and chins resembling fine mustaches that have influenced Yamatai nobility culture. They tend towards more scholarly, introspective, or noble personalities</p>
		<p class="racebox">Every Draconian is precious and wise in Yamatai culture. And due to this burden of meeting the high standards set for them by the culture, Yamatai Draconians are nearly always perfectionists or secret balls of anxiety-riddled outward calm. Others can make mistakes, or have lapses in judgment. Failures in respect, decorum, and judgment are particularly damning for the Metallic Draconians. Each is instilled from an incredibly young age that they are the bar with which all of society should model itself and strive to achieve. This is good and bad, as a Yamatai Draconian who is shamed or loses face publicly is often a far fiercer and ruthless foe than the worst Khitani Tyrant. For as with everything else, even revenge is done to perfection.</p>
		<p class="racebox">Order exists for the Strong to yoke the useless, fleeting, pathetic lives of the Weak to greater Purpose. The Dragon-Emperor may be the living incarnation of the Dragon-God; but if his soldiers are gone, every Draconian is a God unto themselves. The legendary racial disdain with which the Chromatic Draconians approach nearly all other races and cultures has only served to militarize their neighbors and further reinforce the Chromatics beliefs in a vicious cycle. Khitan respect familial legacy above all else. There are no kings, princes, lords, and ladies among the Chromatic Draconians. They have One Emperor whose reach extends as far as every other Draconian- where he can enforce his will directly and not one hair further. Rigidly honorable, their society enforces respect in a compulsive degree- the better to keep legendary tempers from turning its populace among themselves in constant civil wars. Two Chromatic Draconians of a rival, enemy Gods, could meet one another, exchange frigidly polite conversation and pleasantries, negotiate on behalf of one another's Legacy, and calmly agree to murder one another at the approved date at the approved time with all forms filled out in triplicate and witnessed. Toxic Bureaucracy and the Constant Threat of others form the pillars that uphold this society.</p>
		<p class="racebox">In Yamatai the Draconians are Honored Ancestors, Defenders and Protectors. Rare is the Family that does not claim Kinship with some line of the Dragons-Blood. They are storied protectors against the Oni and Yokai. The defeaters of Maho sorcerers and protectors of both the Noble Spirit, Pride, and Knowledge of their uplifting ancestors. As they ascend through the stages of life, the Yamatai Draconians take more and more effort to develop all those around them to the height of their potential. While well-meaning, this leads to spectacularly high rates of suicide and exile among the culture as Honor is stressed to a level that it is far more valuable than a Life. An Occurance which disturbs some of these Noble Draconians</p>
		<p class="racebox">In Khitan the Draconians are Tyrants, Slave-masters and at best Benevolent Dictators. Every province is governed by the fiat of the ancient dragon which has claimed it. Many of these being survivors of Mount Meru, whose now-mortal lives are still measured in Milennia as opposed to centuries. Tyranny is the watchword. Rewards within the Police state are potent and swaying for the discovery of rebellion. Many people simply disappear. The last great rebellion coincided with the defeat of the Hyrkanians and their Harpy 'patrons' at the Dragons Wall. In response, the Dragon-Emperor of the time demanded three out of every ten Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Fae, and Beastfolk be executed in ritual sacrifice. Khitan Draconians find religion to be either intensely personal or irrelevant. Multiples Sects, Cults, and 'Traditional Tribal Practices' flourish from Province to Province. Only the overwhelming racial need for hierarchy, structure, and order keeps the entire Empire running.</p>
