      <p class="racebox">Solar Elves, the proud, imperial, and orderly variation of elves. From gleaming, gold-domed cities they pursue magical research, endlessly seeking to gain a deeper understanding of the unseen forces that guide the weave. Their arcanists are without equal across the realms, and they pride themselves on their impressive, disciplined armies, who combine potent, innate magic with deadly archery. Though they have a cordial relationship with their Moon-Elf brethren, they consider them far too whimsical to be noteworthy as leaders, just the same, they consider the Woodland elves to be savage, uncivilized, and misguided in their pursuit of the wilds. They bear a longstanding negative view of both the Khorgrohk, and the Dark Elves, considering their dusky kin and their ways of life as beyond saving.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Solar Elves are quite a bit taller than other elven variations, with bronzed skin and angular features. Their hair colour varies but often tends towards pale golden, copper red, or chestnut brown. Their eyes tend to give off a faint glow, shimmering with bright colours, their irises tend to be gold-flecked, usually considered a sign of beauty among them. For dress, they prefer stylized silk garments, elaborately ornamented armors, and an emphasis on arches. They tend to not be very muscular, their physical strength usually not something a mere human could not contend with. For battle, they favour swords, archery, and arcane devices which they employ with great efficiency during skirmishes, though far less flexible and adaptable than their woodland kin, or their Moon-Elf counterparts, they counteract this shortcoming (which they view as a strength) with rigorous discipline and practice.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Where the Moon Elves are adventurous and open-minded, the Solar Elves tend towards a more sedentary lifestyle, only really expanding when a new discovery demands their attention. Solar Elves are usually more adventurous in their younger years, often traveling across continents in the search for forgotten lore or mythical creatures.  After driving the savage Khorgrohk away from the ancestral plains where the weave was the strongest, they raised gleaming, golden cities with massive spires raging above the shattered ruins of the Khor cities and broken idols therein. Some Solar Elves felt a tug of sympathy for the Khorgrohk, taking pity on the brutes they had reduced to tribes of rowing savages so effortlessly, some hushed down ballads of Solar-Elven origin still tell tales of wayward women attempting to civilize these brutes, though they tend to not end on a very pleasant note. Due to longstanding feuds with the Khor, they are ever vigilant for attacks and raids from their kind.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Solar Elven society is fairly hierarchic, with noble titles passing from parent to heir. They place great emphasis on titles when making introductions, particularly if they are speaking with an outsider, and it is likely also why they so often come across as condescending or belittling. Due to their rigorous society, most Solar Elves tend to try their very best to conform to the expectations placed upon them, but even society as strict and hierarchical as theirs is not without its delinquents. It is considered unbecoming for a Solar Elf of high birth to marry into a lower rank, being seen as a demotion, though their formal title may not disappear. This is also likely why so much of their woe-filled poetry laments the feelings of being caged by duty. Due to feuds with both Dark Elves and Khorgrohk, they are unlikely to be friendly or forthcoming at all with their kind.</p>
