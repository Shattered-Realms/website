      <p class="racebox italictext">"Nor is it to be thought...that man is either the oldest or the last of earth's masters, or that the common bulk of life and substance walks alone. The Old Ones were, the Old Ones are, and the Old Ones shall be. Not in the spaces we know, but between them, they walk serene and primal, undimensioned and to us unseen. Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through again. He knows where They had trod earth's fields, and where They still tread them, and why no one can behold Them as They tread."</p>
      <p>-Abdul Alhazred. Book of the Dead.</p>
      <p class="racebox"></p>
      <p class="racebox">Embodying wrath, conquest and war itself, Carnivans are monstrous behemoths of fire and perdition.  Possessing immense strength and fortitude, the carnivan favours conquest through raw, brute force or unyielding negotiation above all else. Being bound to a mortal, that mortal will in turn tie their soul into eternal servitude of whatever Daemon prince has enveloped their mind in it’s grasp. They act as enforcers and conquerors, subjugating through sheer force, those who resist the infernal pull of sin and debauchery. Though they are very rare, as the binding process is a brutal and agonizing ordeal, they are nonetheless described in vivid, and sometimes exaggerated detail in demonological texts, their brutal forays into the mortal realm leaving behind broken men and violated women.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Carnivans are hulking, lumbering monstrosities in the vague shape of men, though seared in burning red or ashen gray. They possess spiked, heavy tails, and wide, iron-wrought hooves. From their heads they sport large, jutted horns, facing forwards in an aggressive manner, and their maws are filled with brutal fangs. Sometimes their bodies are branded with the sigil of the daemonic entity under which they serve, though often their chests, backs, arms and legs are too seared with scars from battle to distinguish what they mean. They possess immense, unnatural strength, able to fling a fully grown man several feet away, and thick scales that render them invulnerable to all but the most hallowed and well forged weaponry.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Daemons do not possess a society like our own, prior to being bound to a mortal, they are but malevolent spirits in a sense, without means to interact with the material world in any significant way, outside of tempting mortals. Though with the shattering of the planes, the membrane that separated our own realm from that of theirs, and other creatures, was torn apart, letting these malevolent entities more easily enter the mortal realm to expand their sphere of influence. In meddling with mortal societies however, Carnivans are usually brutish enforcers of whatever daemon prince they are sworn to serve.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Like all Daemons, Carnivans are unable to tell a lie when asked directly. To Daemons, words are the means by which they manifest themselves in reality, and as such, being caught telling a lie will weaken the Daemon substantially, perhaps even to the degree of severing the bond between the bound entity and its host. When not asked a question, Daemons cannot help themselves but to spout lies, falsehoods, and blaspheme against any entity that is not their Daemon overlord, for any deity is in direct opposition to their own. The only Deities which harbor power over Daemons to a degree that they do fear them, are the Outer Gods, beyond space and time, though those deities care little for what occurs in the mortal realm, or in the infernal.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Carnivans can hardly bear the sight of one another out in the mortal realm, and consider other daemons, particularly those in the employ of other princes, as direct rivals to themselves, and will often forgo opportunities for conquest if it means bringing a disadvantage to their rival. The weak must fear the strong, and this is the law in the infernal realm as well, a Daemon who does not stake his claim, will often end up demoted, losing his power, and growing weak.</p>
