      <p class="racebox">Kitsune were a small, vulpine race, typically female. Though they were a mischievous, and curious race, they were not usually dangerous or malicious. However, in myth and legend, the Kitsune were depicted as Soul Stealers, very similar in nature to that of a succubus. This couldn't be further from the truth however, they were a flirty race to be sure, but they had no need or desire for the souls of another being, and usually acted towards some selfish desire such as greed or pleasure.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Small, vulpine, and usually female, though males are also seen amongst the species. The males themselves are usually smaller and more effeminate in nature than males of other species. 
        
        They had three forms, which were their human form, which they used to blend into society, then their hybrid form, which was their true form which showed off their fox ears, their tail, and usually some other features like whiskers, or their nose. And finally the form of a fox. Their colors ranged from silver, black, and red. Their human forms could have any color in both skin tone and hair color.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Kitsune were free spirits and found themselves moving from place to place, usually alone. Despite their flirty, and nomadic lifestyle the Kitsune mated for life if they ever did find a partner. But this was a rarity, and the Kitsune could find themselves going through a wide range of partners before they find a bond with another, which was usually another of their kind.
        
        The Kitsune originated from the lands of the Khitai, and their clothing, accent, and behavior usually reflected that of a human that lived in such a society. However, there are a few that had been born outside of Khitan and may have adopted the lifestyle of another land instead. Learning to live amongst the humans was something all Kitsune had to do, as to be discovered meant they had to leave before the local's superstitious behavior drew them to violence. It was believed that various body parts of a kitsune offered certain magical or healing properties, such as the tail could assist in the regrowth of lost limbs, which was entirely false...</p>
      <p class="racebox">Kitsune are a mischievous creature, enjoying practical jokes, flirtation, and freedom. They were not usually evil, or even good either, but usually neutral and very selfish. They were also very possessive if they found something or someone they liked, which caused both anger, or even jealousy. A Kitsune who finds their emotions running high, such as anger, fear, love, grief, would usually find their human disguise falling, revealing their true hybrid form. Be distrustful, and careful about who you let close.</p>
