      <p class="racebox">Cambions, the unfortunate spawn of humans and demonic creatures, possess a natural aptitude for the arcane, and an innate pull towards dark pursuits. Some choose to embrace their fiendish heritage in full, becoming powerful demonologists or fearsome warlocks, while others actively try to redeem themselves, endlessly fighting against their devious thoughts and desires.   When not shunned for their fiendish heritage, or in the unusual event they are accepted by their human counterparts, they are often found busying themselves with scholarly pursuits or taking up a life of adventure. If not being challenged or given room to reach their potential, they are prone to fall into boredom and melancholy, pursuing physical pleasures and escapist fantasies, possessing a strong hedonistic streak that some choose to fully embrace, while others try to overcome.</p>
      <p class="racebox">Cambions are as varied as humans in terms of build, some being tall and slender, others possessing an immense physical fortitude and bulk. From their heads they sport demonic horns as a grim reminder of their dark ancestry, often curving in elaborate shapes, and it is not uncommon for them to be well taken care of, as many cambions take a perverse, thinly veiled pride in their demonic heritage. Their skin colours range from fiery reds, ashen gray, pale golden, or more exotic variants such as teal or purple. Their tails are semi-prehensile, often ending in spades, and their legs typically end in hooves rather than feet, giving them an uncanny, inhuman air, despite their overall humanoid appearance. The more demonic aspects a cambion sports, the less they are likely to fit in with civillized society at large</p>
      <p class="racebox">Being the bastard children of bloodlines that ought not to be mingled, some of wich can trace their ancestry back to demonic bargains in the days of ancient empires like Acheron, Cambions possess no culture of their own, often taking up various bits and pieces of whatever city or outpost they settle in. Some have a manner of dress as alien as their heritage, blending Stygian silks with Aquilonian steel greaves, some choose to hide their more inhuman features out of shame, while others dress provocatively and alluring in an attempt to entice humans into accepting them out of dark desires. Despite often being treated as outcasts, loners, or untouchables, Cambions are often quite intelligent and litterate, possessing a catlike curiosity that often leads them down paths to forgotten knowledge or a life of adventure. A small handful of them, those that dwell in societies more accepting of their likes, such as Zamora, Khitai or Yamatai, tend to make a name for themselves as skilled and knowledgeable arcanists or lorekeepers. The more physically endowed of their kind often find employ as mercenaries or mob bosses, their intimidating presence and uncanny powers giving them an edge in the shady dealings of the underworld</p>
      <p class="racebox">While not evil from birth as many tend to see them as, Cambions always have dark urgings and temptations tugging at their minds. Even in the most repentant and shamefilled of their kind, the battle against temptations and wicked inclinations is a daily struggle that few of them ever overcome, lending some truth to most humans perceptions of them as perverse and immoral abominations that are at best, ostracized and cast out, or at worst, hunted down as monsters. It is not uncommon for them to seek company with the lower ranks of society where they find a semblance of belonging, or pursue an artistic outlet for their frustrations. As far as personality goes, they tend to be fairly human, but one ought to never forget that they are plagued by dark desires and inclinations.</p>
